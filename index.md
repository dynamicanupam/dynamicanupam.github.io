### Lending Club Case Study using Exploratory Data Analysis

This case study is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The finance company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. In this case study, I used Exploratory Data Analysis to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

> Python packages used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
