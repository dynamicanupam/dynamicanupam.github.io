### Lending Club Case Study using Exploratory Data Analysis

This case study aims to explore the key factors (or driver variables) influencing loan default, specifically identifying variables that strongly indicate default. The finance company can apply this insight to enhance its portfolio and risk assessment. The project employs techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, distribution plotting, visualization, and Hypothesis Testing to analyze the impact of consumer and loan attributes on default tendencies.

### House Price Prediction Using Advanced Regression

This case study aims to understand and solve House Price Prediction problem within the Real Estate domain, exploring how data can be leveraged effectively to tackle business challenges like this. Our objective is to forecast house sales price in a specific area and understand which factors are responsible for higher property value. We aim to address this challenge by employing Advanced Regression Technique like Ridge and Lasso with Cross Validation.

### Telecom Churn Case Study (Keggle Hackathon)

In the telecommunications industry, customer retention is a significant challenge, with customers often switching operators in search of more attractive schemes and offers. This case studyâ€™s objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn. This model aims to forecast whether a customer will migrate to a different provider in a specific month, using past data. The ultimate goal is to prevent customer churn by accurately predicting such behavior.

### Skin Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network

This case study focuses on the development and application of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the early and accurate detection of melanoma, a type of skin cancer that is responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. The objective is to create a solution that can analyze images and alert dermatologists about the potential presence of melanoma, thereby potentially reducing the manual effort required in diagnosis.
