### Lending Club Case Study using Exploratory Data Analysis

This case study aims to explore the key factors (or driver variables) influencing loan default, specifically identifying variables that strongly indicate default. The finance company can apply this insight to enhance its portfolio and risk assessment. The project employs techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, distribution plotting, visualization, and Hypothesis Testing to analyze the impact of consumer and loan attributes on default tendencies.

### Telecom Churn Case Study (Keggle Hackathon)

In the telecommunications industry, customer retention is a significant challenge, with customers often switching operators in search of more attractive schemes and offers. This case study’s objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn. This model aims to forecast whether a customer will migrate to a different provider in a specific month, using past data. The ultimate goal is to prevent customer churn by accurately predicting such behavior.

### Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN, RNN, Transfer Learning

In this case study, we’re part of a tech team at a leading electronics company, known for its innovative smart TVs. We’re tasked with developing a unique feature that allows the TV to identify five specific user gestures, eliminating the need for a remote. The TV’s integrated webcam monitors these gestures, each triggering a distinct command:

- Thumbs up: Volume up.
- Thumbs down: Volume down.
- Left swipe: Rewind 10 seconds.
- Right swipe: Fast forward 10 seconds.
- Stop: Pause playback.

These gestures are identified using various Deep Learning Models such as Conv3D, CNN combined with LSTM, CNN combined with GRU, and CNN combined with GRU (with trainable weights from Transfer Learning).
